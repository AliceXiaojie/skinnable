What do we need in a data structure?

Example module: LittleBits Arduino (http://littlebits.cc/bits/arduino)
	- Has a USB micro connector on one end
	- Has 6 magnetic connectors, 3 per side
		- Side 1
			- D1/TX (out)
			- D5~ (out)
				- with physical toggle switch between analog/PWM
			- D9~ (out)
				- with physical toggle switch between analog/PWM
		- Side 2
			- D0/RX (in)
			- A0 (in)
			- A1 (in)

Object: Module
Purpose: To hold information about an individual electronic component
	module (e.g. a LittleBit module)
Members:
	- type (object type, inherit)
	- name (individual name for visual display)
	- id (e.g., LittleBits ID such as "w6")
	- cost of module (e.g. 1 for wire module)
	- connections
		- name (e.g. "A0")
		- direction (in/out)
		- what it's connected to
	- position (center x,y; rotation)
	- fixed (boolean)
	- size (in holes or in mm?)
	- whether rotation matters (e.g. button is rotation-invariant)

See arduino.json for an example.


Object: Connection
Purpose: To expose a connectable part of a module to other modules,
	to represent the type and direction of the connection, and to hold
	information about what else the module is connected to.
Members:
	- name (e.g. "A0")
	- direction (in/out)
	- what it's connected to

Ideally:

	a = new Arduino({name: 'Arduino 1'});
	b = new Arduino({name: 'Arduino 2'});
	a.D1.connect(b.D0);
