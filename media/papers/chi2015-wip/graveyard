	As digital fabrication technologies become more available to the
	home user, it will be necessary to accomodate a range of skills for
	end users. Most current 3D printing technology, for example, still
	requires more knowledge and skill than the average non-technical
	user might possess. In this project, our goal is allow non-expert
	users to download objects and imbue them with some functionality.

	This work was inspired by the observation that for many potential
	fabricated interactive objects, the electronic functionality is the
	same or similar, and is only loosely coupled to the physical form.
	For example, the BitWear project \cite{Lyons:2013jc} placed the same
	button/LED/radio module into various 3D printed forms. We imagine a
	system of modular, easy-to-assemble electronics (e.g.,
	LittleBits\footnote{\url{http://littlebits.cc}},
	magnetically-connectable modules) that can be placed within
	fabricated objects to give them interactive capabilities.
